# 🤖 BotForgeX: Multimodal Neural Engine
**Architected by blueplaysgames3921 | Powered by Pollinations.AI**

This is a high-performance, multimodal Discord chatbot generated via the **BotForgeX Factory**. This bot doesn't just process text—it utilizes a "Neural Routing" system to switch between specialized AI models based on the complexity and nature of user input.

## ⚡ Quick Start (Windows Local)
1. **Configure Identity**: Locate \`env.txt\` in this folder. Open it and paste your **BOT_TOKEN**, **POLLINATIONS_KEY**, and Discord IDs.
2. **Launch**: Locate the file \`INSTALL_AND_LAUNCH.txt\`. 
   - **Important**: Rename this file to \`launch.cmd\`.
   - Right-click and **Run as Administrator**.
   - The script will automatically verify your Node.js version, install all dependencies, and ignite the bot core.

## 🛠 Manual Setup & Hosting
If you are on Linux, Mac, or using a VPS (Railway, AWS, DigitalOcean):
1. **Environment**: Rename \`env.txt\` to \`.env\`.
2. **Install**: Run \`npm install\` in your terminal.
3. **Execute**: Run \`npm start\` or use PM2 (\`pm2 start index.js\`) for 24/7 uptime.

## 🧠 Neural Routing Logic
Your bot has been configured with a "Dynamic Brain" that switches models based on context:

* **Vision (Gemini-Fast)**: Triggers automatically when an image is uploaded. It analyzes the visual data through your bot's specific persona.
* **Imaging (Flux)**: Triggers when a message starts with \`draw:\`. Generates high-fidelity images directly in the chat.
* **Voice (Edge-TTS)**: If enabled, the bot generates high-quality audio responses when it detects keywords like "speak" or "voice."
* **Short-Burst (Qwen-Character)**: Handles rapid-fire, short messages (<30 tokens) with low-latency, casual responses.
* **Complex Logic (OpenAI/Qwen-Coder)**: Engages when the bot detects code requests or deep analytical prompts (>100 tokens).
* **Default State (Nova-Fast)**: The balanced engine for standard conversation.

## 🎭 Persona & Behavior
**This bot is hard-coded with the custom personality you defined in the BotForgeX Factory.** - **Casual Mode**: If enabled, the bot will communicate in lowercase-only to maintain a relaxed, "human" feel.
- **Natural Triggers**: The bot is designed to be "social." It doesn't just wait for pings; it monitors conversation flow and will randomly contribute based on the message frequency thresholds you set during configuration.
- **Contextual Memory**: The engine fetches and analyzes the last 30 messages in a channel to ensure its responses aren't just accurate, but relevant to the ongoing "vibe."

## 🛰 Tech Specs
- **Engine**: Node.js / Discord.js v14
- **Architecture**: Native \`https\` logic (Zero-Axios footprint for speed)
- **Memory Profile**: Ultra-lightweight (64MB - 128MB RAM)
- **API Uplink**: Pollinations.AI Neural Gateway

> **Safety Warning**: Keep your \`.env\` or \`env.txt\` file private. This file contains your Bot Token. If leaked, unauthorized users can control your bot.
